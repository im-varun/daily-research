# Daily Research

Daily Research is a real-time latest research papers reader, built in Python using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). It uses present day RSS feeds from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) to fetch metadata about latest research paper published in various scientific fields (Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, etc.)

**Important Information**  
Daily Research displays only those research papers that are mentioned in arXiv's RSS feeds on the present day. Research papers mentioned in old RSS feeds are not available in Daily Research. Also, RSS feeds from arXiv are unavailable on Saturdays, Sundays and on occasional holidays. Therefore, Daily Research will not display any search results on those days.

# Features

1. **Interactive Category Selection:** Easily choose and manage preferred research paper subject categories.
2. **Filter for Search Results:** Refine search results by subject subcategory, announce type and keywords.
3. **Pagination:** Navigate easily through large sets of search results.
4. **Direct Links to Research Paper Website and PDF:** Access the main arXiv website and PDF of the research paper directly from the reader.
